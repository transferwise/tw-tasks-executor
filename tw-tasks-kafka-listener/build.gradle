ext.projectName = "TwTasks Extension - Kafka Listener"
ext.projectDescription = '''
Set of components that simplify consumption of kafka messages from arbitrary topic
with further convertion of those to task instances. While providing sensible defaults
the extension is not as flexible as kafka integration oriented libraries, such as spring-kafka,
consider using those instead if more flexibility is needed.

Note that later the extension is deprecated and later on will removed in preference to kafka libraries.
